Don't panic if you're unsure about picking up data-readers. It turns out that tagged
literals are mostly harmless. Much as Douglas Adams produced "The Hitchhicker's Guide"
material in multiple forms, a Clojure programmer can assign data-readers to process tagged
literals with customized implementations. Clojure 1.5 adds a new feature that makes dealing
with unknown tags simple and convenient. We'll also talk about the Extensible Data Notation
(EDN), which aims to be the Babel fish of data transfer. Finally, we will explore a few
unorthodox uses for data-readers.
