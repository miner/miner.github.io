## Presented at Clojure/conj, December 2016

The art of juggling has fascinated people since the days of ancient Egypt. In this talk, we
posit that juggling theory can inform software development. We start with the mathematical
insights of Claude Shannon, renowned as the father of Information Theory. After introducing
“siteswap” notation, we use Clojure to visualize juggling patterns. Finally, we review some
interesing results in neuroscience regarding juggling.
